  <p> <strong><a href="http://www.paradiso.cat/" target="_blank" title="Paradiso Homepage">Paradiso</a></strong>, most anticipated stop in Barcelona! When I was visiting Milan few months back, I’ve met amazing bartender from Paradiso and have been looking forward to come here since. Speakeasy with Pastrami bar as a front, their cocktail and presentations were wicked. Their interior reminded me of Gaudi with beautiful curvatures, and despite being Monday, there were already few other groups waiting for them to open door on 7pm, and entered as soon as they opened.</p>

  First drink I had was <strong>Samurai Sling</strong>. It was refreshing, but at the same time, fills the mouth so that I could enjoy it very much.
  I’ve ordered <strong>pulled pork with Kimchi</strong>, and as a Korean, I had to say that they nailed the usage of kimchi, more like a pickle rather than strong overwhelming flavor which was simply great.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:10px;">And the last but not least, <strong>Mediterranean Treasure</strong>. Amongst extraordinary presentations of Paradiso cocktails, this was superb. Filled in a seashell, and burning rosemary for the smokiness, the best part is the single leaf that comes with it. When I just had the cocktail, it was bit flat with overwhelming smoky nose. However, when I ate the oyster leaf which ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE OYSTER, and drank the cocktail, everything made perfect sense and made an amazing harmony in my mouth. I fell in love with it and the bar. I would definitely recommend here if you are looking for some stylish and amazing cocktails.</p>
