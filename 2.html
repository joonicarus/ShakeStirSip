    <strong><a href="http://www.drymartiniorg.com/locales/dry-martini-v2/?lang=en" target="_blank" title="Dry Martini Homepage">Dry Martini</a></strong>, one of the Barcelon's most renow classic cocktail bar where more than 1,000,000 glasses of dry martini were served. You can surely expect the best service, cocktails and atmosphere here. They had a very interesting Speakeasy Restaurant where you go through corridor of open kitchen to get to the restaurant. Very nice, cozy place with great atmosphere.

  <p style="margin-top:10px;"> I have to say that there is no other cocktail as simple and complicated as <strong>Dry Martini</strong>. Gin, Dry Vermouth, bitter; With these three ingredients bartenders make wonder in a cocktail glass, and those in Dry Martini made an amazing cocktail, one that will be my reference for any other dry martini that Iâ€™ll try from now on.</p>
